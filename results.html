        These children need to learn to become more flexible so that they can adjust better to changes;
        Give fore-warnings and information before transition.
        This will help to make transitions smoother because he knows what will happen next and what behavior is expected.
        Introduce small changes a little at a time.
        Small changes a little at a time can ease them into being more comfortable with new routines
        Use the idea of watching the clock or having a timer.
        Allow these devices, rather than yourself, to determine when activities have to be changed.
        This will cut down on power struggles and resistance.

        Encourage children to join activities. Balance that with avoiding putting any pressure on.

				<h4>Affective Disposition.</h4>
				<p id="affectiveresult1">
					Allow expression,
					Little ones can't differentiate between their emotions and their "selves." Accept your child’s emotions, rather than denying or minimizing them, which gives children the message that some feelings are shameful or unacceptable.

					Listen to your child’s feelings,
					Remember, rage doesn't begin to dissipate until it feels heard. Whether your child is 6 months or sixteen, she needs you to listen to the feelings she’s expressing. Once she feels and expresses them, she’ll let them go and get on with her life.


				</p>
				<p id="affectiveresult2">
					Let Your Child Make Mistakes,
					Teach your child that mistakes are part of the learning process so he doesn’t feel ashamed or embarrassed about getting something wrong.

					Make Gratitude a Priority,
					Gratitude is a wonderful remedy for self-pity and other bad habits that can prevent your child from being mentally strong. Help your child affirm all the good in the world, so that even on his worst days, he’ll see that he has much to feel thankful for.

				<h4>Emotional Expression.</h4>
				<p id="resultxp1">
					<span class ="highlight">Low Emotional Expression -</span>
					Tune into your child’s feelings by looking at their body language, listening to what they are saying and observing their behavior.
          The different feelings that your children go through daily may be foreign to them at first, but you  can help them out by naming those feelings appropriately.
          Provide lots of opportunities to identify feelings in others. You might ask your child to reflect on   what someone else may be feeling. Cartoons or picture books are a great way discuss feelings and helps kids learn how to recognize other people’s feelings through facial expressions.

				</p>
				<p id="resultxp2">
		      <span class ="highlight">High Emotional Expression -</span>
					Stay present and resist the urge to make your child’s bad feelings go away. Support your child to identify and express their feelings so they are heard. When feelings are minimized or dismissed, they will often be expressed in unhealthy ways.Praise your child when they talk about their feelings or express them in an appropriate way. Not only does it show that feelings are normal and it’s okay  to talk about them, it reinforces the behavior so they are likely to repeat it.

				<h4>Emotional Perception.</h4>
				<p id="resultpercp1">
					<span class ="highlight">Low Emotional Expression -</span>
					Help your child recognize their own emotions.
          Once you help your children "name" their own emotions, whether it be frustration or anger or disappointment, they can start taking ownership. Here you will not only spell out what they are feeling, but in what context it is affecting others. When they are feeling upset or discouraged, ask them to describe what they are feeling or get them to write it down or draw it.

					Talk about your own emotions with your child.
					The best way to foster emotional perception is to show it. Tell your children how you are feeling and allow them to perceive it for themselves. We often only think about emotions when they are big and hard to deal with, like feeling disappointed or sad or angry and your children will likely know when you are feeling any of these. You can also demonstrate here how you deal with your own big emotions and "get over" anger or disappointment.

				</p>
				<p id="resultpercp2">
					<span class ="highlight">High Emotional Expression -</span>
					Accept emotional responses as legitimate,
					even if you don't like the behavior the feeling produces. For example, when a child hits, the feeling of anger is demonstrated. Stop the child and say, "It's okay to feel angry; it's not okay to hurt others. Talk to me about what your feeling."

					Keep lines of communication open.
					You might say something like: "Emily, I am glad you told me about your mom's illness. It must be hard to have her in the hospital. Please know that I care about you and that I am here if you want to talk again."

					Avoid negative statements
					like, "Can't you do anything right?" or "What's your problem?" These comments discourage open communication and suggest that when a child does not behave perfectly, he or she is "bad."

				<h4>Emotional Regulation.</h4>
				<p id="resultreg1">
					 <span class ="highlight">Low Emotional Regulation -</span>
					Don’t place a child next to someone who knows how to push his buttons. Give the child a plan for handling a problem situations. I.e
         “When you don’t understand an assignment, I want you to raise your hand and say, ‘I think I  need a little help to get me started on this.
         If your child gives up without trying when a homework assignment appears difficult, suggest, “Here’s what I want you to say to yourself before starting this: ‘I know this will be hard for me, but I’m going to keep trying.
        If I get stuck after trying hard, I will ask for help.'”

				</p>
				<p id="resultreg2">
					<span class ="highlight">High Emotional Regulation -</span>
					Praise the child whenever they show high emotional regulation. You can do this by appreciating trhe child when for instance the child does  not get angry when the child fails to get what he wants, you can thank them for being mature about the situation.

					<span class = "highlight">Low level of Positive peer relations</span>
					Encourage the child to keep a journal about social interactions.Ask them to describe their feelings about these events and interactions. Just as in the example above, ask them to identify what they did well. What should they have done differently? How did their behavior affect the other person?
					Encourage participation in age-appropriate community or church projects.
          These provide meaningful ways to engage with others, toward a common purpose.
				</p>
				<p id="resultpeer2" >
						<span class = "highlight">High level of Positive peer relations</span>
						Create social options for children, without creating pressures. Take care not to communicate the expectation that children should be liked by "all of the people all of the time."

Some children may be contented with few friends. Some popular children may have such high expectations that they never feel socially successful.

By starting early and encouraging your child in the right way, you can help them develop a trait that will be useful to them for the rest of their lives.
